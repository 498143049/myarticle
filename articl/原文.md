+Kidnapping robot problem. This question is a variant of global positioning Problem, but harder. During operation, the robot can be kidnapped and moved to another location. Kidnapping robot problem Is more difficult than the global localization problem, because the robot may be Believe it knows where it is not. Localization in the world, there are robots Know it does not know where it is. People may think that robots are few Was kidnapped in practice . But the actual importance of the problem arises. From most of the most advanced positioning algorithms can not be observed Guarantee never fail. The ability to recover from failure is critical The autonomous robot has tested the localization algorithm by kidnapping The ability to recover from the failure of global localization.

### Static Versus Dynamic Environments
A second dimension that has a substantial impact on the difﬁculty of localization isthe environment. Environments can be static or dynamic.
+ Static environments. Static environments are environments where the only vari-able quantity (state) is the robot’s pose. Put differently, only the robot moves instatic environment. All other objects in the environments remain at the same lo-cation forever. Static environments have some nice mathematical properties thatmake them amenable to efﬁcient probabilistic estimation
+ Dynamic environments. Dynamic environments possess objects other than therobot whose location or conﬁguration changes over time. Of particular interestare changes that persist over time, and that impact more than a single sensorreading. Changes that are not measurable are of course of no relevance to local-ization, and those that affect only a single measurement are best treated as noise(cf. Chapter 2.4.4). Examples of more persistent changes are: people, daylight(for robots equipped with cameras), movable furniture, or doors. Clearly, mostreal environment are dynamic, with state changes occurring at a range of differentspeeds

Obviously, localization in dynamic environments is more difﬁcult than localization instatic ones. There are two principal approaches for accommodating dynamics: First,dynamic entities might be included in the state vector. As a result, the Markov as-sumption might now be justiﬁed, but such an approach carries the burden of additionalcomputational and modeling complexity; in fact, the resulting algorithm becomes ef-fectively a mapping algorithm. Second, in certain situations sensor data can be ﬁlteredso as to eliminate the damaging effect of unmodeled dynamics. Such an approach willbe described further below in Section 8.4
